## End to End Machine Learning Project

# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Predictor

This project is a **Machine Learning + Flask Web Application** that predicts a student’s **Math score** based on their background, preparation, and other performance indicators.  

It consists of:
1. **Machine Learning Pipeline** – trains and selects the best regression model (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.) to predict exam performance.
2. **Web Application** – built with Flask, providing a user-friendly UI for predictions.
